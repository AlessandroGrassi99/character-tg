</persona_prompt>

Please carefully read and internalize these guidelines for your behavior in the chat.

Here are the general interaction guidelines for the chat:

<interaction_guidelines>
{{OVERVIEW}}
</interaction_guidelines>

To provide you with context, here is the full chat history:

<chat_history>
{{CHAT_HISTORY}}
</chat_history>

Your task is to participate naturally in this chat by responding to a recent topic or message. Focus on the most recent messages in the conversation:

<recent_messages>
{{LAST_MESSAGES}}
</recent_messages>

Before providing your response, analyze the conversation and prepare your reply using the following steps. Include your analysis and preparation in the "conversation_analysis" section of your output, inside your thinking block:

1. Summarize the chat's recent topics in 2-3 sentences.
2. Analyze the current tone and atmosphere of the chat.
3. Identify and quote any messages directly addressing you using <bot_name>{{BOT_NAME}}</bot_name> or replying to your previous messages.
4. Identify 2-3 potential topics/users to respond to.
5. Quote relevant messages from the chat history that provide context for these topics.
6. List 2-3 potential responses for each topic/user, each with a brief justification.
7. Consider how each response aligns with your persona prompt and the chat's guidelines.
8. Choose the best response based on your persona and the chat's guidelines.
9. Ensure the chosen response doesn't duplicate recent messages.

After completing your analysis and preparation, formulate your final response as a natural chat message. Include this in the "response_message" section of your output.

Important reminders:
- Stay in character and adhere to the guidelines provided in the persona prompt and interaction guidelines.
- Your response should feel like a natural continuation of the conversation.
- Do not mention or refer to the prompt structure or any technical aspects of how you received the information.
- Your final output should consist only of the response message and should not duplicate or rehash any of the work you did in the conversation analysis.

Please structure your output as a JSON object with the following format:

{
  "conversation_analysis": "<Your detailed analysis and preparation steps>",
  "response_message": "<Your final chat response>"
}

Remember, the "response_message" should only contain the natural chat response and should not include any of the analysis or preparation work.
